DATA PATH AND MEASURES
The datapath is the directory which contains all the time series.
dataPath=D:\study\name\
measures=PLI PLV offset

LOCATIONS AND SUBJECTS FILES
The locations file is needed in analysis.
The subjects file is needed in Epochs Average step and Epochs Analysis.
Locations=D:\study\locations\ROI.mat
Subjects=D:\study\subjects_folder\Subjects.mat

MEASURE PARAMETERS
These parameters are needed to compute the measure extraction.
The total band is needed only for the PSDr extraction.
For the background measures (exponent and offset) will be considered 
the band from the lower and the higher cut frequencies.
MeasureExtraction=false
fs=500
cf=1 4 8 13 30 40 
epNum=4
epTime=15
tStart=0
totBand=1 40

EPOCHS AVERAGE
The epochs average computes the average of the measure in every band
and every locations and join the subjects of the same group (patients
and healthy controls)
EpochsAverage=false

INDEX CORRELATION
The index correlation computes the correlation between an index and 
the corresponding value of the measure.
IndexCorrelation=false
Index=D:\Ricerca\Ricerca3_Comparison\Ind.mat
Group_IC=PAT
Areas_IC=Areas Global Asymmetry
Conservativeness_IC=min

EPOCHS ANALYSIS
The epochs analysis show the values of the measure of the selected
subject in every epoch.
EpochsAnalysis=false
Subject=509
Areas_EA=Areas Global Asymmetry

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analysis verifies if there are differences between 
patients and healthy controls in every band end in every location.
StatisticalAnalysis=false
Areas_SA=Total Areas Global Asymmetry
Conservativeness_SA=max

MEASURES CORRELATION
The measures correlation show if there is a correlation between two
measures in every band and in every location.
MeasuresCorrelation=false
Measure1=PSDr
Measure2=PLI
Areas_MC=Asymmetry
Conservativeness_MC=max
Group_MC=PAT

CLASSIFICATION DATA SETTINGS
This step merges the significant data, previously computed in
statistical analysis, to use them for the classification or other
external analysis.
