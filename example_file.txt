STUDY PARAMETERS
The datapath is the directory which contains all the time series.
dataPath=D:\study\name\
measures=PLI PLV offset
save_figures=1
format=.jpg


EXTERNAL FILES
The locations file is needed in analysis.
The subjects file is needed in Epochs Average step and Epochs Analysis.
The filter file is used in order to substitute the default filter with an custom one.
Locations=D:\study\locations\ROI.mat
Subjects=D:\study\subjects_folder\Subjects.mat
filter_file=athena_filter.m


MEASURE PARAMETERS
These parameters are needed to compute the measure extraction.
The total band is needed only for the PSDr extraction.
For the background measures (exponent and offset) will be considered 
the band from the lower and the higher cut frequencies.

cf=1 4 8 13 30 40 
epNum=4
epTime=15

The epochs average computes the average of the measure in every band
and every locations and join the subjects of the same group (patients
and healthy controls)
EpochsAverage=false

The network metrics computations allows to extract some network metrics
on a connectivity measure

the corresponding value of the measure.

between the two studied groups

U-Test
The U test verifies if there are differences between patients and 
healthy controls in every band end in every location.

MEASURES CORRELATION
The measures correlation show if there is a correlation between two
measures in every band and in every location.
MeasuresCorrelation=false

Measure2=PLI
Areas_MC=Asymmetry
Conservativeness_MC=max
Group_MC=PAT


SCATTER ANALYSIS
The scatter analysis show a scatter plot related to two measures, 
also with different frequency and spatial parameters, or related to
different parameters of a single measure, which allows a visual 
analysis between them
